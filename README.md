**CTotem** is a mod that helps ease the early days of survival.

If you don’t want to lose all your resources before you get your hands on a real Totem of Undying, you can use CTotem.

When your HP drops below a certain threshold, CTotem will either automatically send a command in chat (such as `/lobby` or `/spawn`) or disconnect you from the world—depending on your settings.


# Using

You can configure everything through the mod menu: 
- Enable/disable the mod 
- Choose the CTotem mode: send command or disconnect
- Set the HP threshold at which CTotem will activate
- Define the command that should be sent

## Command

CTotem also includes a simple command to toggle the mod on or off without opening the mod menu: 

```
/ctotem toggle
```
